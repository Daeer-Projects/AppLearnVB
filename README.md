## Introduction

This application and the database that is used, was created for a school project.

### Explain, Demonstrate, Imitate, Practice

This is a simple method of how to learn things, shortened to EDIP.

The process goes along the states of learning.

* Explain - the instructor explains the step that is being taught.
* Demonstrate - the instructor demonstrates the step with examples, re-enforcing the step that was just explained.
* Imitate - the instructor gets the student to imitate what they have just demonstrated.  The instructor and student do the actions or work together.
* Practice - the student repeats the steps that have just been taught to re-enforce the learning session.

If the student struggles at any point, the instructor will revert back to the previous point, and move on from there.
